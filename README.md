**Currently this package is only used to generate the itp_X.db database file for use in MATLAB.**

# ITP-Python
The Ice Tethered Profiler is an autonomous instrument that vertically profiles the water column under sea ice. The ITP collects measurements of conductivity, temperature, and depth. Data are automatically transmitted back via satellite.  [Learn More](http://www.whoi.edu/itp "Learn More")

## Motivation
To date, 110 ITP systems have been deployed, and more than 110000 water profiles have been collected. As these data continue to accumulate, and the number of users working with the data increases, the need has become apparent for a set of tools to access, search for, and manipulate ITP data.

## Features
Build an SQLite database from itp_final profiles

## Usage
Download all itpXfinal.zip profiles from the WHOI ftp server. Unzip, and point PATH to the containing folder
